                Reading is fun when you have a good story or book. 
                Right now i'm reading a series called Wings of Fire which i'm just 
                done with over half, but still have a lot more to read.
                If you have a bad story or book you won't get the mode 
                and will hate to read.
                I was like that for a long time, but later I started to 
                explore the books and started liking to read.
                It's a really fun hobby.
